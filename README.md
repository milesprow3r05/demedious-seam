The account data logger. It saves the collected data in a simple text file.
However, you can configure [**.htaccess**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.htaccess) or other server config in order to restrict access to the file with logs.
Back in the day, **Demedious Seam** was a system for closed Dial-up network with absolutely different name; there was no malice at all.
In the end of 2020, the logger form has been renamed and reconstructed.
Currently, it's a logger with very simple, not flexible, a bit dummy realisation; but yet â€” an account logger with easy installation.
